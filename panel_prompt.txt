Create a complete server-side application using PHP that includes a web-based panel to receive and display data from an Android application.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Backend (PHP):**
    *   Create a PHP script named `receive.php` that can receive HTTP POST requests.
    *   The script should expect a single parameter: `deviceName`.
    *   It should sanitize the received data to prevent security vulnerabilities.
    *   Store the received device name along with a timestamp in a simple text file (`devices.txt`) on the server. Each entry should be on a new line in the format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - [Device Name]`.

2.  **Frontend (HTML/CSS):**
    *   Create an HTML file named `panel.html` that serves as the admin panel.
    *   The panel should have a clean and simple interface.
    *   It should automatically refresh every 10 seconds to display the latest data.
    *   The panel must read the `devices.txt` file and display its contents in a clear, readable format (e.g., in a table or a styled list).

3.  **Security:**
    *   Ensure that the `devices.txt` file is not directly accessible from the web.
    *   Sanitize all data to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.

**Deliverables:**

*   `receive.php`: The PHP script to handle incoming data.
*   `panel.html`: The HTML file for the admin panel.
*   `.htaccess` (optional but recommended): To restrict direct access to the data file.
*   A brief explanation of how to set up and use the panel.

The final panel should be easy to deploy on a standard web server with PHP support.
