Your web panel is correctly coded, but it is blank because of browser security rules. To see your panel work, you must serve it using a simple local web server.

Here are the step-by-step instructions:

**Step 1: Open Command Prompt**

*   Click your Windows Start button.
*   Type `cmd` and press Enter. A black command prompt window will open.

**Step 2: Navigate to the Web Panel Directory**

*   In the command prompt window, you need to change the directory to where your web panel files are located.
*   Copy the following command exactly as it is:

      cd "C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\xHERO Panel\xHERO Web Panel"

*   Paste it into the command prompt window and press Enter.

**Step 3: Start the Local Web Server**

*   Now, type the following command into the same window and press Enter:

      python -m http.server 8000

*   You may see a message like "Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/)". This means the server is running. Do not close this window.

**Step 4: View Your Panel**

*   Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
*   In the address bar, go to the following URL:

      http://localhost:8000

*   Your xHERO Control Panel will now load correctly and display your list of devices.

**If you get an error in Step 3:**
If it says `'python' is not recognized...`, try this command instead:

`py -m http.server 8000`
